Capstone Project Part -2

After researching different pok√©mon websites and UI Resources I've decided to go with a modern, feminine and clean interface. There are many women out there who love pokemon, but there isn't a interface with a more feminine and minimal aesthetic.

I've chosen pastel colors, and as for imagery I will try to develop them using Artificial Intelligence if possible. I want the pokemon to look like animated characters.

Although I have only designed a few pages for the app, the main idea is to have the home page, with the recent updates, a page for every character showing tabs such as About, Stats, Moves and Evolutions; as well as the pokedex showing which pokemons have been caught.

/// After reading the project file cautiously I learned that the images and all the data will be provided through an API. With that in mind, I won't have to develop the images and the website will be much simpler than before.

I intend for it to have:
- a log in / sign up page
- main page with all the pokemons, with infinite loading (20 at a time)
- pop up page for each pokemon containing its characteristics, that will be activated when the user clicks on a character.
